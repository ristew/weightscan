What happens when you apply t-SNE to the hidden states of a transformer langauge model? In this case we take phi-2 and see how the layer state evolves as it goes through 32 layers, projecting the hidden state into 2 dimensions. What we get is a view into the geometric progression of the model as it predicts the next token.
